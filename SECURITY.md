- The KitchenAsty API server (`packages/server`)
- Authentication and authorization mechanisms
- Payment processing (Stripe integration)
- Database access and data exposure
- Cross-site scripting (XSS) in admin and storefront

## Security Best Practices for Self-Hosters

If you are self-hosting KitchenAsty, please ensure:

- All environment variables with secrets (JWT keys, Stripe keys, database URLs) are kept secure
- HTTPS is enabled via a reverse proxy (Nginx, Caddy, etc.)
- The database is not exposed to the public internet
- Regular backups are maintained
- Dependencies are kept up to date

See the [Self-Hosting Guide](https://mighty840.github.io/kitchenasty/self-hosting/overview.html) for detailed setup instructions.
